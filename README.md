# encryption_decryption_in_c_language
Program description:
        This program is an ecryption decryption program. It displays a menu of services for the user, 
        the user gets to choose the srvice they want. The user can enter a number and encrypt it to verify
        if it is the correct code. The user can decrypt as well after encryption. After that the user can 
        display the number of successful/unsuccessful verification. Final service is to end the program. 
        Each service including displaying the menu has a different function. 
        
        This program will not verify an encrypted code more than once. Encryption can only happen if code was
        entered. Decryption happen only if code was already encrypted. The program checks with user if they are 
        are sure they want to end the program. 
        This program validates input for user in menu choice, it also does not allow the user to enter a digit that
        is larger than 9 or smaller than 0.
